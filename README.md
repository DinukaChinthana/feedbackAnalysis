# Identifying Student Feedback Using Pre-Trained NLP Models

## Overview
<p>Welcome to my final year project repository! This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the ChatGPT API to analyze and predict student feedback. The system consists of two main components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A Streamlit-based web page for collecting student feedback and predicting its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in real-time.</li>
  <li>A separate Streamlit web page for visualizing the aggregated student feedback, providing valuable insights for administrators.</li>
</ol>

## Project Features
### Feedback Collection & Sentiment Prediction
<ul>
  <li><b>Real-Time Sentiment Analysis:</b> Collects student feedback and predicts sentiment using pre-trained NLP models via the ChatGPT API.</li>
  <li><b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> An intuitive Streamlit web application for easy feedback submission and immediate sentiment prediction.</li>
</ul>

### Feedback Visualization for Administration
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Visualization:</b> Displays aggregated feedback data through interactive and insightful visualizations.</li>
  <li><b>Administrative Insights:</b> Helps administrators make informed decisions based on comprehensive feedback analysis.</li>
</ul>

## Impact
<p>This project aims to empower educational institutions by providing a robust tool to understand and act on student feedback. By leveraging advanced NLP models, administrators can gain deeper insights into student sentiments, ultimately leading to an enhanced educational experience.</p>
